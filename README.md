## Summary

To summarize, the results would seem to conclude that Men are the largest demographic present followed by Females with subscriptions having the highest use of the bike-share system. The Des Moines bike-share would best start by targetting Men with the highest budget in advertising and push subscription to encourage more use of the system. With a strong demographic having more continual use of the product, the company should see an increase in popularity and subscriptions over time.
